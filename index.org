Welcome to E110!  "Engineering Computing Architecture" is about how computers are built from simpler components, and how they encode information into physical parts.  Along the way, we will also cover the Linux shell, Hardware Description Languages (HDL) and intermediate Python programming.

* Prerequisites
  Students should have already taken ENGR-E 101 Innovation and Design: https://registrar.indiana.edu/browser/soc4192/ENGR/ENGR-E101.shtml

  Students should also come to E110 prepared with:
  - intermediate computer literacy
    - editing, saving, and sharing documents
    - working knowledge of Windows, MacOS, and/or Linux
  - beginner experience in Python programming language (variables, functions, loops, lists)
  - beginner experience with electronics (knowledge of transistors, microcontrollers, voltage, electricity)

* Outcomes
  Students will finish E110 with knowledge in:
  - fundamentals of digital logic (gates from transistors, complex gates from simple gates)
  - how a CPU is constructed, as a system, from simpler components
  - number representations (decimal, hexadecimal, binary)
  - Linux command-line interface (CLI)
  - MyHDL (hardware description language in the form of a Python library)
  - intermediate Python

* Materials/Textbooks
  - Textbook ::
  /The Elements of Computing Systems/ by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. ISBN 978-0262640688

  This course covers chapters 1-6: https://www.nand2tetris.org/course, also available here: [[./Nand2Tetris/chapters]]

  - Python ::
              Use the docs for Python version 3.7.2 (latest stable release): https://docs.python.org/3/

  - MyHDL ::
             [[http://docs.myhdl.org/en/stable/][Manual]] and [[http://www.myhdl.org/docs/examples/][Examples]]

* Conduct
  - Lab/Classroom etiquette ::
  1. Respect others who want to work or listen quietly, minimize distractions.
  2. No food or open drinks.  Non-spill bottles are OK.
  3. Leave the lab at least as clean as you found it.
  4. Log out before leaving.

  - Do your own work ::
  Collaboration for learning and helping each other is encouraged, however all assignments must be exclusively /your own work/.  Cheating results in 0 credit for the assignment, reporting to the Dean, and possible further consequences.

  See the [[http://studentcode.iu.edu/responsibilities/academic-misconduct.html][official IU policies]] for more information.

  - No late work ::
  You may submit multiple times to the Autograder; the highest scoring submission is the one that will be used in grading. No submissions after the deadline will be accepted. Sometimes the Autograder server may be heavily used and respond more slowly, so plan accordingly.

  Extensions may be given to *individuals* in extreme circumstances, such as medical emergencies (Dr. note required). Extensions may be given to the *whole class*, if 5+ students request more time.

* Schedule
