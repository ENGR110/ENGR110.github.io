* Implement the Hack CPU in MyHDL
  : See Slide 48 of Lecture 5

** Describe required components
   Write interfaces (using MyHDL syntax) for each of the required top-level components of the Hack CPU:

   - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
   - Program Counter
   - A register
   - D register
   - Mux16

** Describe top-level interface

   : See Slide 30 of Lecture 5

   Write the interface (using MyHDL syntax) to the top-level of the CPU, i.e. the inputs and outputs of the CPU which connect to the larger Hack Computer.

* Implement the Hack Computer in MyHDL + Python
  Use Python3 to simulate screen/keyboard

** Testing
   Design a test that exercises the entire Hack CPU, from power-on time through interactive program usage.
