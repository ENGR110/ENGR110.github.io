* Logistics
  - *Final Exam* is Thursday, April 25
    - 11:15am- is at your normal lab time (11:15am or 4:00pm) on Thursday, April 25.
  - *Make-up Final* for those unable to attend Thursday is:
    - 10:15am-12:15am Thurs., May 2 (10678 lab section)
    - 5:00pm-7:00pm Thurs., May 2 (29714 lab section)

  You may bring 1 A4 (8.5 x 11 inches) paper of original (not photocopied) hand-written notes.

* Topics Covered
** Binary Arithmetic
   two's complement addition/subtraction

** Python programming
   - variables
   - loops (for, while)
   - list (array-like) indexing by number
   - dictionary (struct-like) indexing by name
   - imports and accessing members of python modules (e.g. =import foo= followed by =foo.example(42)=)
*** Libraries
    - =str.split()=
    - =myhdl.bin()=
    - =sys.argv=
*** built-in datatypes
**** strings
     - =mystring = ''=
     - =mystring = 'hello world!'=
     - =x = mystring[1:-4]=
     - =mystring += '\n'=
**** lists
     - =mylist = []=
     - =mylist = [1,3,5]=
     - =mylist[-1] = 10=
**** dictionaries
     - =mydictionary = {}=
     - =mydictionary = {'a': 1, 'b':2}=
     - =mydictionary['key'] = value=

*** scoping rules
    - define/assign values before they're referenced
    - modifying values inside vs. outside of a function
    - returning values from a function vs. modifying values external to a function

** Basic Logic Gates
   Nand, Or, etc.

** Intermediate Logic Gates
   Mux, Demux, Or8Way, etc.

** MyHDL concepts
   - hierarchical modeling
   - difference between a =Signal= and a regular variable
   - combinational versus sequential logic
   - purpose of =always_comb= and =always_seq=
*** Describe required components
    Write interfaces (using MyHDL syntax) for each of the required top-level components of the Hack CPU:

    - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
    - Program Counter
    - A register
    - D register
    - Mux16 (example: =def Mux16(a, b, select, out)=)

** Hack CPU
   : See Slides 30 and 48 of Lecture 5
   Identify in a diagram, and describe the purpose of:
*** registers
    - how to construct a 1-bit register using a DFF and Mux
    - how to construct an N-bit register from N 1-bit registers

*** program counter
    purpose and behavior

*** ALU
    - describe purpose of input control bits and output control bits
    - how do these relate to the Hack Assembly and Hack binary formats?

*** program memory, data memory
    What is each used for?
    How does it relate to the symbol table?
