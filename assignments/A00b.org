* SSH and MyHDL
This assignment will introduce ~ssh~ as well as ~MyHDL~.  ~ssh~ or /secure shell/ is a method for connecting from one computer to another over an encrypted channel.  While you may not have anything to hide, the encryption provides a measure of trust - you can be reasonably sure that your traffic is not being tampered with.

In Linux, the syntax for connecting to the machine called ~silo.sice.indiana.edu~ is:

#+begin_src
ssh yourusername@silo.sice.indiana.edu
#+end_src
