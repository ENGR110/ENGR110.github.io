* Assignment
  Using only ~Nand~, ~0~, and ~1~, create MyHDL code for the following functions (see also Figure 1.2 in [[https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/44046b_f2c9e41f0b204a34ab78be0ae4953128.pdf][Ch1]]):

* Background
  Recall that Nand is a "universal gate" and can be used to construct all the other gates.

  For example, if ~Nand~ was a regular function in Python, it might look like this:


  We could use it to generate the other Boolean functions.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
def Not(x):
    return Nand(x, 1)

def Or(x, y):
    return Nand(Not(x), Not(y))

def And(x, y):
    return Not(Nand(x, y))
  #END_SRC

  Similarly we could write functions in terms of Nand:

* MyHDL boilerplate
  For each primitive gate, you can start with the following "boilerplate" code and add your implementation.
