* Process
Describe the process of starting with a truth table (as a requirement) and realizing the result in hardware using physical chips.

* Task: DMUX
This task is to describe the implementation of a 2-output Demultiplexer, using the same hierarchical approach as was used in the MyHDL.

For example, the DMUX should be constructed of only primitive gates such as AND, XOR, NOT, etc.

** questions
1. list the subcomponents (primitive gates) and any leftover gates
2. how do you find the physical pin locations on the chips?
3. which specific pins end up as the input and output interface to the DMUX?
4. what should be done with unused input and output pins?

* Part 1 of 2: single bit adders

  Given the chips:

  - 74LS132
  - 74LS136

  Construct a 1-bit full adder which satisfies this truth table:

  | carry in | A | B | sum | carry out |
  |----------+---+---+-----+-----------|
  |        0 | 0 | 0 |   0 |         0 |
  |        0 | 0 | 1 |   1 |         0 |
  |        0 | 1 | 0 |   1 |         0 |
  |        0 | 1 | 1 |   0 |         1 |
  |        1 | 0 | 0 |   1 |         0 |
  |        1 | 0 | 1 |   0 |         1 |
  |        1 | 1 | 0 |   0 |         1 |
  |        1 | 1 | 1 |   1 |         1 |

** steps to complete:

   1. find pinout for each chip
   2. test all gates on each chip are functional
   3. wire the circuit on a breadboard

** Complications
   - 74LS132 contains only NAND. How can we construct a full adder using only XOR and NAND?
   - 74LS136 has open-collector outputs. Use a pull-up resistor to provide logic high for each XOR output you use.

** Hints
   Connect wires one at a time, double-checking as you go.  Debugging circuits with many wires is harder than debugging small circuits with few wires.

   Make connections /before/ applying power.  A misplaced wire can destroy a chip in milliseconds.
