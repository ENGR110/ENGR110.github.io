* Process
Describe the process of starting with a truth table (as a requirement) and realizing the result in hardware using physical chips.

* Task: DMUX
This task is to describe the implementation of a 2-output Demultiplexer, using the same hierarchical approach as was used in the MyHDL.

For example, the DMUX should be constructed of only primitive gates such as AND, XOR, NOT, etc.

** questions
1. list the subcomponents (primitive gates) and any leftover gates
2. how do you find the physical pin locations on the chips?
3. which specific pins end up as the input and output interface to the DMUX?
4. what should be done with unused input and output pins?
