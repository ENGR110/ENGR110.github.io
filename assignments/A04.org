* Part 1 of 2: single bit adders

  Given the chips:

  - 74LS132
  - 74LS136

  Construct a 1-bit full adder which satisfies this truth table:

  | carry in | A | B | sum | carry out |
  |----------+---+---+-----+-----------|
  |        0 | 0 | 0 |   0 |         0 |
  |        0 | 0 | 1 |   1 |         0 |
  |        0 | 1 | 0 |   1 |         0 |
  |        0 | 1 | 1 |   0 |         1 |
  |        1 | 0 | 0 |   1 |         0 |
  |        1 | 0 | 1 |   0 |         1 |
  |        1 | 1 | 0 |   0 |         1 |
  |        1 | 1 | 1 |   1 |         1 |

** steps to complete:

   1. find pinout for each chip
   2. test all gates on each chip are functional
   3. wire the circuit on a breadboard

** Complications
   - 74LS132 contains only NAND. How can we construct a full adder using only XOR and NAND?
   - 74LS136 has open-collector outputs. Use a pull-up resistor to provide logic high for each XOR output you use.

** Hints
   Connect wires one at a time, double-checking as you go.  Debugging circuits with many wires is harder than debugging small circuits with few wires.

   Make connections /before/ applying power.  A misplaced wire can destroy a chip in milliseconds.
